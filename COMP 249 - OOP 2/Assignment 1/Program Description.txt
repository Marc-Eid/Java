In this Assignment we made several classes of different transportations methods. 

The mains topics that were covered:
	1. Inhritance
	2. Polymorphism
	3. Encapsulation
	4. Abstract Classes
	5. Varags 
	6. Enums



The difference between these 2 parts is in part 1, the attributes in the classes have the protected modifer. thus we were able to use their names
in the subclasses.

on the other hand in part 2 we respected encapsulation more and improved privacy by making these attributes private. We referenced them using getters
and setters methods.
